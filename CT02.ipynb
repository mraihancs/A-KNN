In our example N = 8. The puzzle is divided into $\\sqrt{N+1}$ rows and $\\sqrt{N+1}$ columns. Eg. 15-Puzzle will have 4 rows and 4 columns and an 8-Puzzle will have 3 rows and 3 columns. The puzzle consists of N tiles and one empty space where the tiles can be moved. Start and Goal configurations (also called state) of the puzzle are provided. The puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles one by one in the single empty space and thus achieving the Goal configuration.\n","\n","![download.png](data:image/png;base64,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
